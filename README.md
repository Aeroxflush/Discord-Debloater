# Discord-Debloater

Discord Debloater for convenience and performance. It will be updated every time a new version of Discord comes out.
When they delete the Discord cache for the first time when they open it they will not see anything, they must restart discord again

## **Changelogs:** Added Dynamic Shortcut to batch script

(because discord changes the folder every time if there is an update. for example, from `app-1.0.9148` to `app-1.0.9149`)
